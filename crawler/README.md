# Setup Instructions - Mac

## Initial
1. First, start a virtual environment.
2. Next out by setting your environment variables in setup/set_env.sh
3. Once you set the environment variables to the correct values, run `source setup/set_env.sh` to load the environment variables into the environment. Additionally, this will install all the dependencies for you.
4. (Optional) Take all the scripts under the script folder and move it to the correct directory so that you can run the bash scripts without calling `source` everytime.

## Crawl
1. To crawl, run `crawl`.

Crawling will essentially start the crawling spider with the options set in the `code/spider.py` file.
