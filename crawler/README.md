# Setup Instructions

## Crawl 

1. Create a data directory in the fnab_network/crawler/ directory
2. Create a urls file which lists (line-by-line) the urls you want to begin crawling
3. Run "source crawl" to crawl using the code/spider.py file
4. To run a different spider, run "source crawl <spider file name>.py"

You can also move the "crawl" bash script to env/bin/ and can simply run "crawl" in the future.
